However, tables are not inherently designed to store data with mixed data representations or hierarchal structures. This limitation was addressed in the early 1990's with the advent of automation, spurred by increasingly complex data needs for power systems operations. The industry required standardized models to exchange larger and more complex sets of information, and so resorted to an object-oriented data model. The CIM was developed and later made a standard maintained by the IEC - Technical Committee 57 Working Group 13. The aim was to provide a standard definition for power system components that could be used in automated EMS and asset-management databases.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"From the computer engineering point-of-view, using tables would require to re-write a lot of code.
