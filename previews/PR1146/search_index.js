In PowerSystems.jl, a component associated to a DynamicInjector (for example an AVR) specifies the set of states that specific component requires to be modeled accurately.\nStatic: Typically refers to steady state data or models where the power system and each of its components are assumed to be operating at a steady state equilibrium point. This includes both power flow data for a single time point simulation as well as quasi-static time series data and models, where the power system is at an equilibrium point at each time step. Static data can be used as the input to single time point power flow models and production cost models with, for example, 5-minute, 15-minute, or 1-hour Resolution.

might not be currently synchronized with the power system, but can come online quickly after an unexpected contingency, such as a transmission line or generator outage. To model the time varying requirement, a \"requirement\" time series should be added to this reserve.\n\nThis is only an upwards reserve.

This excitation systems consists of an alternator main exciter feeding its output via non-controlled rectifiers. The exciter does not employ self-excitation, and the voltage regulator power is taken from a source that is not affected by external transients. Parameters of IEEE Std 421.5 Type AC2A Excitacion System. The alternator main exciter is used, feeding its output via non-controlled rectifiers. The Type AC2C model is similar to that of Type AC1C except for the inclusion of exciter time constant compensation and exciter field current limiting elements.
