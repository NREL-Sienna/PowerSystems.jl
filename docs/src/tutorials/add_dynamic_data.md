# Adding Data for Dynamic Simulations

In this tutorial, we are going to add dynamic data to a power [`System`](@ref), including
a dynamic generator suitable for phasor-type simulations, as well as a dynamic inverter
and dynamic lines necessary for more complex EMT (electro-magnetic transient)
simulations.

To run a dynamic simulation in Sienna\Dyn using
[`PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl`](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl/stable/),
two data layers are required:

 1. A base layer of [static](@ref S) components, which includes the data needed to run a
    power flow problem
 2. An additional layer of [dynamic](@ref D) components, which define differential equations
    to run a transient simulation

We'll define these two layers sequentially.

## Defining the Static Data Layer

Instead of defining the static data in the `System` manually, we will load an existing three-bus system using
[`PowerSystemCaseBuilder.jl`](https://github.com/NREL-Sienna/PowerSystemCaseBuilder.jl)
to use as a starting point.

Start by importing these packages:

```@repl dyn_data
using PowerSystems
using PowerSystemCaseBuilder
const PSY = PowerSystems;
```

To create the system, load pre-existing data for a 3-bus system using
`PowerSystemCaseBuilder.jl`:

```@repl dyn_data
threebus_sys = build_system(PSIDSystems, "3 Bus Inverter Base")
```

See that there is a table of "Static Components", but no "Dynamic" data yet.

Let's view the generators in the system with [`show_components`](@ref),
including which bus they are connected at:

```@repl dyn_data
show_components(ThermalStandard, threebus_sys, [:bus])
```

Notice that there are generators connected at Buses 2 and 3, but not Bus 1.

Now, we are going to add the data needed to run an EMT simulation.
We will add an infinite voltage source to Bus 1, which is the last component we
need to complete the static data layer. Then, we will a dynamic
generator or inverter model to the two generators, as well as adding dynamic lines.

## Add an Infinite Voltage Source

Add a infinite voltage source with small impedance to Bus 1 (the reference bus).
First, retrieve the reference bus using [`get_components`](@ref):

```@repl dyn_data
slack_bus = first(get_components(x -> get_bustype(x) == ACBusTypes.REF, Bus, threebus_sys))
```

Notice we filtered by the [bus type](@ref acbustypes_list) to get the bus(es) we wanted.

Next, manually define a [`Source`](@ref):

```@repl dyn_data
inf_source = Source(;
    name = "InfBus", #name
    available = true, #availability
    active_power = 0.0,
    reactive_power = 0.0,
    bus = slack_bus, #bus
    R_th = 0.0, #Rth
    X_th = 5e-6, #Xth
);
```

And add it to the system:

```@repl dyn_data
add_component!(threebus_sys, inf_source)
```

This completes the first layer of [static](@ref S) data, using components similar to those
we added manually in the [Create and Explore a Power `System`](@ref) tutorial.

## Adding a Dynamic Generator

Now, we will connect a classic machine model to the generator at bus 102.
Dynamic generator devices
are composed by 5 components: a [Machine](@ref Machine),
[Shaft](@ref Shaft), [Automatic Voltage Regulator](@ref AVR) (AVR),
[Power System Stabilizer](@ref PSS) (PSS), and
[Prime Mover and Turbine Governor](@ref TurbineGov).
For each of those 5 components, we will select a specific model that defines the data and
differential equations for that component,
and then use those 5 components to define the complete dynamic generator.

```

!!! note

    When defining dynamic data, by convention `PowerSystems.jl` assumes that all data is
    in [`DEVICE_BASE`](@ref per_unit).

First, define a [Machine](@ref Machine) that describes the the stator electro-magnetic dynamics:

```@repl dyn_data
# Create the machine
machine_oneDoneQ = OneDOneQMachine(;
    R = 0.0,
    Xd = 1.3125,
    Xq = 1.2578,
    Xd_p = 0.1813,
    Xq_p = 0.25,
    Td0_p = 5.89,
    Tq0_p = 0.6,
)
```

Notice that we selected a specific model, [`OneDOneQMachine`](@ref), with the parameters
tailored to a One-d-one-q dynamic machine model.

Next, define a specific [Shaft](@ref Shaft) model, [`SingleMass`](@ref) that describes the
rotor electro-mechanical dynamics:

```@repl dyn_data
# Shaft
shaft_no_damping = SingleMass(;
    H = 3.01, #(M = 6.02 -> H = M/2)
    D = 0.0,
)
```

Represent the electromotive dynamics of the AVR controller using a specific
[Automatic Voltage Regulator](@ref AVR) model, [`AVRTypeI`](@ref):

```@repl dyn_data
# AVR: Type I: Resembles a DC1 AVR
avr_type1 = AVRTypeI(;
    Ka = 20.0,
    Ke = 0.01,
    Kf = 0.063,
    Ta = 0.2,
    Te = 0.314,
    Tf = 0.35,
    Tr = 0.001,
    Va_lim = (min = -5.0, max = 5.0),
    Ae = 0.0039, #1st ceiling coefficient
    Be = 1.555, #2nd ceiling coefficient
)
```

Define a fixed efficiency [Prime Mover and Turbine Governor](@ref TurbineGov) with
[`TGFixed`](@ref):

```@repl dyn_data
#No TG
tg_none = TGFixed(; efficiency = 1.0) #efficiency
```

See that we are modeling a machine that does not include a Turbine Governor
(or PSS below), but you must define components for them to build a
complete machine model.

Similarly, define a PSS using [`PSSFixed`](@ref), which is used to describe the stabilization
signal for the AVR:

```@repl dyn_data
#No PSS
pss_none = PSSFixed(; V_pss = 0.0)
```

Now, we are ready to add a dynamic generator to the static
generator at bus 102. First, let's get that static generator:

```@repl dyn_data
static_gen = get_component(Generator, threebus_sys, "generator-102-1")
```

Notice that its `dynamic_injector` field is currently `nothing`.

Use its name and the 5 components above to define its [`DynamicGenerator`](@ref) model:

```@repl dyn_data
dynamic_gen = DynamicGenerator(;
    name = get_name(static_gen),
    ω_ref = 1.0, # frequency reference set-point
    machine = machine_oneDoneQ,
    shaft = shaft_no_damping,
    avr = avr_type1,
    prime_mover = tg_none,
    pss = pss_none,
)
```

See that the specific component models that we selected and defined above were used to
specify the states needed to model this generator in a dynamic simulation.

Finally, use the dynamic version of [`add_component!`](@ref add_component!(
sys::System,
dyn_injector::DynamicInjection,
static_injector::StaticInjection;
kwargs...,
)) to add this data to the `System`:

```@repl dyn_data
add_component!(threebus_sys, dynamic_gen, static_gen)
```

Notice that unlike static components, which are just added to the `System`,
this dynamic component is added to a specific static component within the `System`.

!!! tip

    To define identical dynamic devices for multiple generators at once, define the pieces of the
    generator model as *functions*, such as:

    ```
    avr_type1() = AVRTypeI(...
    ```

    When called in the `DynamicGenerator` constructor, this will create a new AVR for each generator, so
    they are different in memory. Later, if you decide to modify the AVR parameters for
    a specific generator, it will not modify the AVR in another generator.

Recall that you can print the system to see a summary of its data:

```@repl dyn_data
threebus_sys
```

See that a new table has been added: "Dynamic Components."

Also, print the static generator to double-check the dynamic layer has been added:

```@repl dyn_data
static_gen
```

Verify that `dynamic_injector` now contains our dynamic generator model.

Up to this point, you have added the dynamic data necessary to do a phaser-type simulation,
which focuses on machine behavior. Now we will also add dynamic inverters and lines to enable
EMT simulations.

## Adding a Dynamic Inverter

Next we will connect a Virtual Synchronous Generator Inverter at bus 103.

An inverter is composed of [Converter](@ref), [OuterControl](@ref), [InnerControl](@ref),
[DCSource](@ref), [FrequencyEstimator](@ref), and [Filter](@ref) components:

```@raw html
<img src="../../assets/inv_metamodel.png" width="75%"/>
```

As we did for the generator, we will define each of these six components with a specific
model, which defines its differential equations.

First, define an [`AverageConverter`](@ref) as the specific model for the [Converter](@ref)
component:

```@repl dyn_data
converter_high_power() = AverageConverter(;
    rated_voltage = 138.0,
    rated_current = 100.0,
)
```

Recall from the tip above that we can define these components as *functions* instead of
objects for reusability across multiple generators, and notice that that is what we have
done here.

Define [OuterControl](@ref) using [Virtual Inertia](@ref) for the active power control and
[ReactivePowerDroop](@ref) for the reactive power control:

```@repl dyn_data
outer_control() = OuterControl(
    VirtualInertia(; Ta = 2.0, kd = 400.0, kω = 20.0),
    ReactivePowerDroop(; kq = 0.2, ωf = 1000.0),
)
```

Define an [InnerControl](@ref) as a Voltage+Current Controller with Virtual Impedance,
using [`VoltageModeControl`](@ref):

```@repl dyn_data
inner_control() = VoltageModeControl(;
    kpv = 0.59,     #Voltage controller proportional gain
    kiv = 736.0,    #Voltage controller integral gain
    kffv = 0.0,     #Binary variable enabling voltage feed-forward in current controllers
    rv = 0.0,       #Virtual resistance in pu
    lv = 0.2,       #Virtual inductance in pu
    kpc = 1.27,     #Current controller proportional gain
    kic = 14.3,     #Current controller integral gain
    kffi = 0.0,     #Binary variable enabling the current feed-forward in output of current controllers
    ωad = 50.0,     #Active damping low pass filter cut-off frequency
    kad = 0.2,      #Active damping gain
)
```

Define a [`FixedDCSource`](@ref) for the [DCSource](@ref):

```@repl dyn_data
dc_source_lv() = FixedDCSource(; voltage = 600.0)
```

Define a [FrequencyEstimator](@ref) as a phase-locked loop (PLL) using [`KauraPLL`](@ref):

```@repl dyn_data
pll() = KauraPLL(;
    ω_lp = 500.0, #Cut-off frequency for LowPass filter of PLL filter.
    kp_pll = 0.084,  #PLL proportional gain
    ki_pll = 4.69,   #PLL integral gain
)
```

Finally, define an [`LCLFilter`](@ref) for the [Filter](@ref):

```@repl dyn_data
filt() = LCLFilter(;
    lf = 0.08,
    rf = 0.003,
    cf = 0.074,
    lg = 0.2,
    rg = 0.01,
)
```

Now, use those six functions to define a complete dynamic inverter
by getting the static component at bus 103:

```@repl dyn_data
gen_103 = get_component(Generator, threebus_sys, "generator-103-1");
```

using it and our six functions to define a [`DynamicInverter`](@ref):

```@repl dyn_data
dynamic_inv = DynamicInverter(;
    name = get_name(gen_103),
    ω_ref = 1.0, # frequency reference set-point
    converter = converter_high_power(),
    outer_control = outer_control(),
    inner_control = inner_control(),
    dc_source = dc_source_lv(),
    freq_estimator = pll(),
    filter = filt(),
)
```

and adding it to the `System`:

```@repl dyn_data
add_component!(threebus_sys, dynamic_inv, gen_103)
```

Both generators have now been updated with dynamic data. Let's complete the `System`
updates by adding dynamic lines.

## Adding Dynamic Lines

!!! warning

    A `System` must have at least two buses and one branch to run a dynamic simulation in
    [`PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl`](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl/stable/).

Let's review the AC branches currently in the system:

```@repl dyn_data
get_components(ACBranch, threebus_sys)
```

Notice that we have three static `Line` components.

Let's also print the first line to review its format:

```@repl dyn_data
first(get_components(Line, threebus_sys))
```

See that these components do not have the fields for dynamic modeling, such as fields for
different [states](@ref S).

Let's update that by cycling through these lines and using [`DynamicBranch`](@ref) to extend
each static line with the necessary fields:

```@repl dyn_data
for l in get_components(Line, threebus_sys)
    # create a dynamic branch
    dyn_branch = DynamicBranch(l)
    # add dynamic branch to the system, replacing the static branch
    add_component!(threebus_sys, dyn_branch)
end
```

Take a look at the AC branches in the system again:

```@repl dyn_data
branches = get_components(ACBranch, threebus_sys)
```

Notice that now there are 3 `DynamicBranch` components instead the `Line` components.

Let's take a look by printing first one:

```@repl dyn_data
first(branches)
```

Observe that this is a wrapper around the static data, with the additional states
data for dynamic modeling.

Finally, let's print the `System` again to summarize our additions:

```@repl dyn_data
threebus_sys
```

Verify that the additions were successful, with an added voltage `Source`, `DynamicBranch`es
replacing the static `Lines`, and two new dynamic components with the generator and inverter models.

## Next Steps

In this tutorial, you have updated a static system with a second dynamic data layer.
The data you added can enable a phasor-based simulation using the dynamic generator, or
a more complex EMT simulation with the additional dynamic inverter and dynamic lines.
