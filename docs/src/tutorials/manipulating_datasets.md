# Manipulating Datasets

`PowerSystems` provides function interfaces to all data, and in this tutorial we will explore how to do this using the [`show_components`](@ref),
[`get_component`](@ref get_component(::Type{T}, sys::System, name::AbstractString) where {T <: Component})/
[`get_components`](@ref), and getter (`get_*`) and setter (`set_*`) functions for component fields.

## Viewing Components in the System

We are going to begin by loading in a test case [`System`](@ref) from [`PowerSystemCaseBuilder.jl`](@ref psb):

```@repl system
using PowerSystems;
using PowerSystemCaseBuilder;
sys = build_system(PSISystems, "c_sys5_pjm")
```

Notice that the print statement for the [`System`](@ref) already includes a basic
summary of the components, including 5 [`ThermalStandard`](@ref) components.
We can use the [`show_components`](@ref) function to get more details:

```@repl system
show_components(ThermalStandard, sys)
```

We can see the names and availability are the standard fields returned when using [`show_components`](@ref).

We can also view specific fields within components using the [`show_components`](@ref)
function. For example, we can view the type of `fuel` the thermal generators are using,
and their current `active_power` and `reactive_power` for a power flow case:

```@repl system
show_components(ThermalStandard, sys, [:fuel, :active_power, :reactive_power])
```

Notice all our thermal generators are currently fueled by coal.

## Accessing and Updating a Component in a System

We can access a component in our system using the
[`get_component`](@ref get_component(::Type{T}, sys::System, name::AbstractString) where {T <: Component})
function. For example, if we are interested in accessing a [`ThermalStandard`](@ref) component we can
do so using the component's name and `Type` from `PowerSystems.jl`'s [Type Tree](@ref).
From above we know the names of the thermal generators.

```@repl system
solitude = get_component(ThermalStandard, sys, "Solitude")
```

Notice that all of Solitude's fields are pretty-printed with the return statment for
quick reference. However, what is returned is a [`ThermalStandard`](@ref) object we can
manipulate:

```@repl system
typeof(solitude)
```

If we are interested in accessing a particular field, we can use a `get_*` function, also known as a getter,
on this object. For example, if we are interested in the `fuel` we can use [`get_fuel`](@ref get_fuel(value::ThermalStandard)):

```@repl system
get_fuel(solitude)
```

You can see a [`ThermalFuels`](@ref tf_list) option returned.

To recap, [`get_component`](@ref) will return a component object, but we can use a specific `get_*` function to return the data in a particular field.

!!! warning
    
    Using the "dot" access to get a field value from a component is actively discouraged, use `get_*` functions instead.
    Julia syntax enables access to this data using the "dot" access (e.g., `solitude.fuel`), however this is discouraged for two reasons:
    
     1. We make no guarantees on the stability of component structure definitions. We will maintain version stability on the accessor methods.
     2. Per-unit conversions are made in the return of data from the accessor functions. (see the [per-unit](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/PowerSystems.jl/stable/explanation/per_unit/#per_unit) section for more details)

To update a field we can use a specific `set_*`, or setter function, which are defined for each component field.
We can use [`set_fuel!`](@ref set_fuel!(value::ThermalStandard, val)) to update the `fuel` field of Solitude to natural gas.

```@repl system
set_fuel!(solitude, ThermalFuels.NATURAL_GAS)
```

We can use [`show_components`](@ref) again to check that the `Solitude` `fuel` has been
updated to [`ThermalFuels.NATURAL_GAS`](@ref tf_list):

```@repl system
show_components(ThermalStandard, sys, [:fuel])
```

Similarly, you can updated the `active_power` field using its specific `get_*` and `set_*` functions.
We can access this field by using [`get_active_power`](@ref get_active_power(value::ThermalStandard)):

```@repl system
get_active_power(solitude)
```

We can then update it using [`set_active_power!`](@ref set_active_power!(value::ThermalStandard, val)):

```@repl system
set_active_power!(solitude, 4.0)
```

We can see that our `active_power` field has been updated to 4.0.

## Accessing and Updating Multiple Components in the System at Once

We can also update more than one component at a time using the [`get_components`](@ref get_components(
::Type{T},
sys::System;
subsystem_name = nothing,
) where {T <: Component}) and `set_*` functions.

Let's say we were interested in updating the `base_voltage` field for all of the [`ACBus`](@ref).
We can see that currently the `base_voltages` are:

```@repl system
show_components(ACBus, sys, [:base_voltage])
```

But what if we are looking to correct them to 250.0 kV?
Let's start by getting an iterator for all the buses using [`get_components`](@ref get_components(
::Type{T},
sys::System;
subsystem_name = nothing,
) where {T <: Component}):

```@repl system
buses = get_components(ACBus, sys)
```

See that the pretty-print summarizes this set of components, but let's check what was actually returned:

```@repl system
typeof(buses)
```

!!! tip
    
    Notice that [`get_components`](@ref get_components(
    ::Type{T},
    sys::System;
    subsystem_name = nothing,
    ) where {T <: Component}) and similar functions return Julia iterators, which allows you to
    access and manipulate data without a large memory allocation that might occur for very
    large data sets.
    Use [`collect`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/#Base.collect-Tuple%7BAny%7D)
    to gather the data to a vector instead, but be aware of your dataset size.

Now using the [`set_base_voltage!`](@ref) function and a `for` loop we can update the voltage:

```@repl system
for i in buses
    set_base_voltage!(i, 250.0)
end
```

We could use [`show_components`](@ref) to verify the results, but this time let's use a
`get_*` function and Julia's dot notation over our bus iterator to get the data for
a specific field from multiple components:

```@repl system
get_base_voltage.(buses)
```

We can see that all of the buses now have a `base_voltage` of 250.0 kV.

If we are interested in updating the `fuel` in all the thermal generators, we would use a similar approach. We begin by grabbing an iterator for all the components in [`ThermalStandard`](@ref).

```@repl system
thermal_gens = get_components(ThermalStandard, sys)
```

Now, using the [`set_fuel!`](@ref set_fuel!(value::ThermalStandard)) and a `for` loop, we will update the `fuel` to `NATURAL_GAS`.

```@repl system
for i in thermal_gens
    set_fuel!(i, ThermalFuels.NATURAL_GAS)
end
```

We can verify that the `fuel` types for all the thermal generators has been updated,
using dot notation again to access the `fuel` fields:

```@repl system
get_fuel.(get_components(ThermalStandard, sys))
```

See that we linked two functions here with Julia's dot notation -- this is a very
convenient way of quickly getting the data you need.

## Filtering Specific Data

We have seen how to update a single component, and all the components of a specific type, but what if we are interested in updating only particular components? We can do this using filter functions.

For example, let's say we are interested in updating all the `active_power` values of the thermal generators except `Solitude`.
Let's start by seeing the current `active_power` values.

```@repl system
show_components(ThermalStandard, sys, [:active_power])
```

Let's grab an iterator for the all the thermal generators except `Solitude` by adding a filter function
in another version of the [`get_components`](@ref get_components(
filter_func::Function,
::Type{T},
sys::System;
subsystem_name = nothing,
) where {T <: Component}) function defined with Julia's multiple dispatch:

```@repl system
thermal_not_solitude = get_components(x -> get_name(x) != "Solitude", ThermalStandard, sys)
```

We can see that only four [`ThermalStandard`](@ref) components are returned, as expected.
Now let's update the `active_power` field of these four thermal generators using the [`set_active_power!`](@ref) function.

```@repl system
for i in thermal_not_solitude
    set_active_power!(i, 0.0)
end
```

Let's check the update using [`show_components`](@ref):

```@repl system
show_components(ThermalStandard, sys, [:active_power])
```

We can see that all the `active_power` values are 0.0, except `Solitude`.

We can filter on any component field. Similarly, let's filter all of the thermal generators
that now have an `active_power` of 0.0, and also set their availability to false.

```@repl system
for i in get_components(x -> get_active_power(x) == 0.0, ThermalStandard, sys)
    set_available!(i, 0)
end
```

## Getting Available Components

The [`get_available_components`](@ref) function is a useful short-hand function with a
built-in filter for grabbing all the components of a particular type that are available.

For example, if we are interested in grabbing all the available [`ThermalStandard`](@ref):

```@repl system
get_available_components(ThermalStandard, sys)
```

We only retrieved one component, because we just set the rest to unavailable above:

```@repl system
show_components(ThermalStandard, sys)
```

## Getting Buses

We can retrieve the [`ACBus`](@ref) components using
[`get_buses`](@ref get_buses(sys::System, bus_numbers::Set{Int})),
by [ID number](@ref get_buses(sys::System, bus_numbers::Set{Int})) or
[`Area` or `LoadZone`](@ref get_buses(sys::System, aggregator::AggregationTopology)).

Let's begin by accessing the ID numbers associated with the [`ACBus`](@ref)
components using the [`get_bus_numbers`](@ref) function.

```@repl system
get_bus_numbers(sys)
```

We can see that these bus IDs are numbered 1 through 5.
Now let's specifically grab buses 2 and 3 using the [`get_buses`](@ref) function:

```@repl system
high_voltage_buses = get_buses(sys, Set(2:3))
```

and update their base voltage to 330 kV:

```@repl system
for i in high_voltage_buses
    set_base_voltage!(i, 330.0)
end
```

As usual, we can review the updated data with [`show_components`](@ref):

```@repl system
show_components(ACBus, sys, [:number, :base_voltage])
```

## Updating Component Names

We can also access and update the component name field using the
[`get_name`](@ref get_name(value::ThermalStandard)) and
[set_name!](@ref set_name!(value::ThermalStandard, name::AbstractString)) functions.

Recall that we created an iterator called `thermal_gens` for all the thermal generators.
We can use the [`get_name`](@ref get_name(value::ThermalStandard)) function to access
the `name` field for these components with dot notation:

```@repl system
get_name.(thermal_gens)
```

To update the names we will use the
[set_name!](@ref set_name!(value::ThermalStandard, name::AbstractString)) function.

!!! warning
    
    Specifically when using [set_name!](@ref set_name!(value::ThermalStandard, name::AbstractString))
    to modify multiple components accessed through an iterator, it is important to note that this
    not only changes the field `name`, but also changes the iterator itself
    as you are iterating over it, which will result in unexpected outcomes and errors.

Therefore, rather than using [set_name!](@ref set_name!(value::ThermalStandard, name::AbstractString))
on an iterator, only use it after first
calling [`collect`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/#Base.collect-Tuple%7BAny%7D)
on the iterator to get a vector of the components:

```@repl system
for thermal_gen in collect(get_components(ThermalStandard, sys))
    set_name!(sys, thermal_gen, get_name(thermal_gen) * "-renamed")
end
```

Now we can check the names using the [`get_name`](@ref) function again.

```@repl system
get_name.(get_components(ThermalStandard, sys))
```

Be aware again that accessing components through a vector using
[`collect`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/#Base.collect-Tuple%7BAny%7D)
might cause large memory allocations, based on your dataset size.

## Next Steps & Links

In this tutorial, we explored a dataset using [`show_components`](@ref) to summarize data
and accessed particular groups of components with [`get_components`](@ref get_components(
::Type{T},
sys::System;
subsystem_name = nothing,
) where {T <: Component}), [`get_buses`](@ref get_buses(sys::System, bus_numbers::Set{Int})),
and [`get_available_components`](@ref).
We used specific `get_*` functions and `set_*` functions to see and update the fields in
[`ThermalStandard`](@ref) and [`ACBus`](@ref) components, but remember that these getters
and setters are available for each data field for components of all Types in `PowerSystems.jl`.
