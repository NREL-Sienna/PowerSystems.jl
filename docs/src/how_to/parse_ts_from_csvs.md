# [Parse Time Series Data from .csv's](@id parsing_time_series)

This example shows how to parse time series data from .csv files to add to a [`System`](@ref).
For example, a [`System`](@ref) created by [parsing a MATPOWER file](@ref pm_data) doesn't contain
any [time series](@ref ts_data) data, so a user may want to add time series to be able to run a production
cost model. For background on the `System` container, see [About the System](@ref system_doc).

```@setup forecasts
using PowerSystems
using JSON3

file_dir = joinpath(pkgdir(PowerSystems), "docs", "src", "tutorials", "tutorials_data"); #hide
sys = System(joinpath(file_dir, "case5_re.m"));
```

Let's use a predefined 5-bus [`System`](@ref) with some renewable generators and loads that
we want to add time series data to:

```@example forecasts
sys
```

## Define pointers to time series files

`PowerSystems.jl` requires a metadata file that maps components to their time series
data in order to be able to automatically construct time series from .csv data
files.

For example, if we want to add a bunch of time series files, say one for each load and one
for each renewable generator, we need to define *pointers* to each time series .csv file
with the following fields:

  - `simulation`:  User description of simulation
  - `resolution`:  Resolution of time series in seconds
  - `module`:  Module that defines the abstract type of the component
  - `category`:  Type of component. Must map to abstract types defined by the "module"
    entry (Bus, ElectricLoad, Generator, LoadZone, Reserve)
  - `component_name`:  Name of component
  - `name`:  User-defined name for the time series data.
  - `normalization_factor`:  Controls normalization of the data. Use 1.0 for
    pre-normalized data. Use 'Max' to divide the time series by the max value in the
    column. Use any float for a custom scaling factor.
  - `scaling_factor_multiplier_module`:  Module that defines the accessor function for the
    scaling factor
  - `scaling_factor_multiplier`:  Accessor function of the scaling factor
  - `data_file`:  Path to the time series data file

Notes:

  - The `module`, `category`, and `component_name` entries must be valid arguments to retrieve
    a component using `get_component(${module}.${category}, sys, $name)`.
  - The `scaling_factor_multiplier_module` and the `scaling_factor_multiplier` entries must
    be sufficient to return the scaling factor data using
    `${scaling_factor_multiplier_module}.${scaling_factor_multiplier}(component)`.

`PowerSystems.jl` supports this metadata in either CSV or JSON formats.

In this example, we will use the JSON format. The example file can be found
[here](https://github.com/Sienna-Platform/PowerSystemsTestData/blob/master/5-Bus/5bus_ts/timeseries_pointers_da.json),
and this is what its pointers look like in the required format:

```@example forecasts
using PowerSystemCaseBuilder #hide
DATA_DIR = PowerSystemCaseBuilder.DATA_DIR #hide
FORECASTS_DIR = joinpath(DATA_DIR, "5-Bus", "5bus_ts"); #hide
fname = joinpath(FORECASTS_DIR, "timeseries_pointers_da.json"); # hide
open(fname, "r") do f # hide
    JSON3.@pretty JSON3.read(f) # hide
end #hide
```

## Read and assign time series to `System` using these parameters.

```@example forecasts
fname = joinpath(FORECASTS_DIR, "timeseries_pointers_da.json")
add_time_series!(sys, fname)
```

You can print the `System` to see a new table summarizing the time series data that has been
added:

```@example forecasts
sys
```
