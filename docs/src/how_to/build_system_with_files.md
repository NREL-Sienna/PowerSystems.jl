# [Building a System from CSV Files](@id system_from_csv)

If you have input data on the component specifications and time series data formatted in
CSV files, rather than a Matpower or PSS/e file that can be
[parsed automatically](@ref pm_data), the basic formula to build a [`System`](@ref)
manually is:

 1. Format all .csv data into row-column format, where there is a row for each component and a
    column for each input parameter. Load each .csv into a `DataFrame`.
 2. Define a [`System`](@ref).
 3. Starting with the buses, write a `for` loop for each component `Type` to loop over the
    `DataFrame`, using a constructor from `PowerSystems.jl`'s Model Library to define a
    component for each row. Hard-code any required parameters that are missing in
    your dataset. Use [`add_component!`](@ref) to add each component to the [`System`](@ref).
 4. Similarly, add cost and time series data either within each `for` loop, or after the
    components have been defined using [`begin_time_series_update`](@ref).
 5. [Save your `System` to a JSON](@ref "Write, View, and Load Data with a JSON") once you are
    finished

The following example demonstrates this process for selected component
types (e.g., [`ACBus`](@ref), [`ThermalStandard`](@ref), [`RenewableDispatch`](@ref)), but
the same principles apply to build any of the components in `PowerSystems.jl`'s Model
Library.

Feel free to reuse the code below, ensuring that you customize the exact file names,
data columns, column names, and hard-coded parameters in the `for` loops based on the data
you have available.

## Prerequisites

In this example, it is assumed that the CSV files are stored in a directory
called `MyData`. In each section below, ensure your data follows the row-column format
before beginning, and that your data are in the given units.

These are the depedencies needed for this how-to:

```julia
using PowerSystems
using CSV
using DataFrames
using Dates
using TimeSeries
```

## Build the base [`System`](@ref)

```julia
system_base_power = 100.0
sys = System(system_base_power)
```

Begin by building the base [`System`](@ref) using the base power in MVA.

## Add Buses and Network Topology

In this example, we assume that the component data for the buses are contained in a CSV
file, `Buses.csv`. Each row is an individual bus, and there is a column for each input parameter:

| Bus Number | BusType | Magnitude (p.u.) | Voltage-Max (p.u.) | Voltage-Min (p.u.) | Base Voltage (kV) | Region |
|:---------- |:------- |:---------------- |:------------------ |:------------------ |:----------------- |:------ |
| 1          | ref     | 1                | 1.06               | 0.94               | 138               | R1     |
| 2          | ref     | 1                | 1.06               | 0.94               | 345               | R2     |
| ...        | ...     | ...              | ...                | ...                | ...               | ...    |

Read in the contents of the CSV file `Buses.csv` to a data frame and customize
the parameter names based on the column names in your CSV file.

```julia
bus_params = CSV.read("MyData/Buses.csv", DataFrame)

min_volt = "Voltage-Min (p.u.)"
max_volt = "Voltage-Max (p.u.)"
base_volt = "Base Voltage (kV)"
bus_number = "Bus Number"
region = "Region"
```

In this example, we assume that the buses are sorted into `Areas`, where
[`Area`](@ref) is an optional parameter in the [`ACBus`](@ref) constructor.
Because we will be sorting our buses into these areas as we construct the
buses, we must first attach the areas to our [`System`](@ref).

```julia
regions = unique(bus_params[:, region])

for reg in regions
    area = Area(reg)
    add_component!(sys, area)
end
```

You could similarly add [`LoadZone`](@ref)s at this point, if they are relevant
for your system.

Now, we are ready to build the buses in the `for` loop, using the
[`ACBus`](@ref) constructor, using the input data available in our `Buses.csv`,
and hard coding any missing data.

```julia
for row in eachrow(bus_params)
    bus = ACBus(;
        number = row[bus_number],
        name = "bus$(row[bus_number])",
        bustype = ACBusTypes.PQ,
        angle = 0.0,
        magnitude = 1.0,
        voltage_limits = (min = row[min_volt], max = row[max_volt]),
        base_voltage = row[base_volt],
        area = get_component(Area, sys, row[region]),
    )
    add_component!(sys, bus)
end
```

## Add Branches

The next step is to build the [`Branch`](@ref) components in the system. In this
example, we only have two branch types: a [`Line`](@ref), if the connecting buses
have the same base voltage; and a [`Transformer2W`](@ref) if they
have different base voltages. You may need to implement additional logic if you
have other branch types as well.

We assume the data for each [`Branch`](@ref) is contained in a `Branches.csv`.
The conventions used in `Bus from` and `Bus to` must be consistent with the
conventions used in the `Bus Number` column of `Buses.csv`.

| Branch Number | Bus from | Bus to | Reactance (p.u.) | Resistance (p.u.) | Max Flow (MW) | Min Flow (MW) |
|:------------- |:-------- |:------ |:---------------- |:----------------- |:------------- |:------------- |
| 1             | 1        | 2      | 0.0999           | 0.0303            | 600           | -600          |
| 2             | 4        | 5      | 0.00798          | 0.00176           | 1700          | -1700         |
| ...           | ...      | ...    | ...              | ...               | ...           | ...           |

Read in the contents of the CSV file `Branches.csv` to a data frame and customize
the parameter names based on the column names in your CSV file.

```julia
branch_params = CSV.read("MyData/Branches.csv", DataFrame)

branch_num = "Branch Number"
bus_from_col = "Bus from"
bus_to_col = "Bus to"
reactance = "Reactance (p.u.)"
resistance = "Resistance (p.u.)"
max_flow = "Max Flow (MW)"
```

Build the lines and transformers using the [`Line`](@ref) and
[`Transformer2W`](@ref) constructors.

```julia
for row in eachrow(branch_params)
    bus_from = get_bus(sys, row[bus_from_col])
    bus_to = get_bus(sys, row[bus_to_col])
    if get_base_voltage(bus_to) == get_base_voltage(bus_from)
        branch = Line(;
            name = "line$(row[branch_num])",
            available = true,
            active_power_flow = 0.0,
            reactive_power_flow = 0.0,
            arc = Arc(; from = bus_from, to = bus_to),
            r = row[resistance],
            x = row[reactance],
            b = (from = 0.0, to = 0.0),
            rating = row[max_flow] / system_base_power,
            angle_limits = (min = 0.0, max = 0.0),
        )
    else
        branch = Transformer2W(;
            name = "tline$(row[branch_num])",
            available = true,
            active_power_flow = 0.0,
            reactive_power_flow = 0.0,
            arc = Arc(; from = bus_from, to = bus_to),
            r = row[resistance],
            x = row[reactance],
            primary_shunt = 0.0,
            rating = row[max_flow] / system_base_power,
        )
    end
    add_component!(sys, branch)
end
```

!!! warning
    
    When defining a branch that isn't attached to a `System` yet, you must define the
    thermal rating of the transmission line [per-unitized in "SYSTEM_BASE"](@ref per_unit)
    using the base power of the `System` you plan to connect it to -- defined above as
    `system_base_power`.

## Adding Thermal Generators and their Costs

### Build Thermal Generators

We assume the data needed to build each [`ThermalStandard`](@ref) unit is found
in a CSV file `Thermal_Gens.csv`. The following table is a snapshot of the
first 7 columns of an example `Thermal_Gens.csv`:

| Gen Name   | Bus | Rating (MVA) | Min Stable Level (MW) | Max Capacity (MW) | PrimeMoveType | Fuel Type    | ... |
|:---------- |:--- |:------------ |:--------------------- |:----------------- |:------------- |:------------ |:--- |
| Biomass 01 | 12  | 3            | 0.9                   | 3.0               | OT            | AG_BIPRODUCT | ... |
| Biomass 02 | 103 | 1.2          | 0.36                  | 1.2               | OT            | AG_BIPRODUCT | ... |
| ...        | ... | ...          | ...                   | ...               | ...           | ...          | ... |

The naming convention used for the contents of the `Bus` column must be consistent
with the convention used in the `Bus Number` column of `Buses.csv`.

Read in the contents of the CSV file `Thermal_Gens.csv` to a data frame and
customize the parameter names based on the column names in your CSV file.  Note
that the [`PrimeMovers`](@ref pm_list) in the `thermal_gens` data frame are
consistent with EIA Form 923, and the `Fuel Type` column data are consistent
with the [`ThermalFuels`](@ref tf_list) naming convention.

```julia
thermal_gens = CSV.read("MyData/Thermal_Gens.csv", DataFrame)

name = "Gen Name"
bus_connection = "Bus"
rate = "Rating (MVA)"
min_active_power = "Min Stable Level (MW)"
max_active_power = "Max Capacity (MW)"
ramp_up = "Max Ramp Up (MW/min)"
ramp_down = "Max Ramp Down (MW/min)"
min_up = "Min Up Time (h)"
min_down = "Min Down Time (h)"
prime_move = "PrimeMoveType"
fuel = "Fuel Type"
```

Build the thermal generator components using the [`ThermalStandard`](@ref)
constructor and data stored in the `thermal_gens` data frame.

!!! warning
    
    When you define components that aren't attached to a `System` yet, the constructors
    assume define all fields related to power are
    [per-unitized in "DEVICE_BASE"](@ref per_unit). Divide all fields with units such as MW,
    MVA, MVAR, or MW/min using the `base_power` of the component (with the exception of
    `base_power` itself, which is in MVA).

Since the example data is missing base power, we set base power equal to the rating data, and the
rating parameter to 1.0:

```julia
for row in eachrow(thermal_gens)
    base = row[rate]
    thermal = ThermalStandard(;
        name = row[name],
        available = true,
        status = true,
        bus = get_bus(sys, row[bus_connection]),
        active_power = 0.0,
        reactive_power = 0.0,
        rating = 1.0,
        active_power_limits = (
            min = row[min_active_power] / base,
            max = row[max_active_power] / base,
        ),
        reactive_power_limits = (min = 0.0, max = 0.0),
        ramp_limits = (up = row[ramp_up] / base, down = row[ramp_down] / base),
        operation_cost = ThermalGenerationCost(nothing),
        base_power = base,
        time_limits = (up = row[min_up], down = row[min_down]),
        prime_mover_type = row[prime_move],
        fuel = row[fuel],
    )
    add_component!(sys, thermal)
end
```

### Add [`ThermalGenerationCost`](@ref)

In this example the [`ThermalGenerationCost`](@ref) constructor is defined by a
[`FuelCurve`](@ref). We are also assuming that the data needed to build each
[`FuelCurve`](@ref) can be found in two separate CSV files. The first,
`Thermal_Gens.csv`, has already been defined in the previous step. The second,
`Thermal_Fuel_Rates.csv`, contains information regarding each [`FuelType`](@ref
tf_list) and its cost:

| Fuel Type    | Fuel Price | CO2 rate | NOX rate | SO2 rate |
|:------------ |:---------- |:-------- |:-------- |:-------- |
| COAL         | 1.8        | 203.5    | 0.382    | 0.33     |
| NATURAL_GAS  | 5.4        | 118      | 0.079    | 0.001    |
| OIL          | 21         | 123.1    | 0.176    | 0.006    |
| AG_BIPRODUCT | 2.4        | 130      | 0.177    | 0.006    |
| GEOTHERMAL   | 0          | 0        | 0.177    | 0.006    |

Read in `Thermal_Fuel_Rates.csv`, customize parameter names based on
the column names in your CSV file, and create a dictionary pairing fuel types
and fuel prices. Ensure that the strings populating the `Fuel Type` column
match the strings populating the `Fuel Type` column of the `thermal_gens`
data frame.

```julia
fuel_params = CSV.read("MyData/Thermal_Fuels_Rates.csv", DataFrame)

type = "Fuel Type"
price = "Fuel Price"

fuel_cost_dict = Dict{ThermalFuels, Float64}()
for row in eachrow(fuel_params)
    fuel_cost_dict[row[type]] = row[price]
end
```

Next, we will create column name variables for heat rate bases, heat rates,
load points, fixed, start up, and shut down costs from the thermal_gens
data frame.  Use this data to build the [`PiecewiseIncrementalCurve`](@ref) and
the [`FuelCurve`](@ref) functions, and add them to their associated thermal
generator.

```julia
gen_name = "Generator Name"
heat_rate_base = "Heat Rate Base (MMBTU/hr)"
heat_rate = "Heat Rate (MMBTU/hr)"
load_point = "Load Point Band (MW)"
fixed_cost = "Fixed Cost (dollar)"
start_up_cost = "Start Up Cost (dollar)"
shut_down_cost = "Shut Down Cost (dollar)"

for row in eachrow(thermal_gens)
    thermal = get_component(ThermalStandard, sys, row[gen_name])
    heat_rate_curve =
        PieceWiseIncrementalCurve(row[heat_rate_base], row[load_point], row[heat_rate])
    fuel_curve =
        FuelCurve(;
            value_curve = heat_rate_curve,
            fuel_cost = fuel_cost_dict[row[fuel]],
        )
    cost_thermal = ThermalGenerationCost(;
        variable = fuel_curve,
        fixed = row[fixed_cost],
        start_up = row[start_up_cost],
        shut_down = row[shut_down_cost],
    )
    set_operation_cost!(thermal, cost_thermal)
end
```

[`ThermalGenerationCost`](@ref).

## Adding Renewable Generators and Their Time Series

The following section demonstrates how to add solar generators and their time
series to a [`System`](@ref). However, if you desire to add other
[`RenewableDispatch`](@ref) generator types, such as wind, the process is exactly the
same, with changing the [prime mover type](@ref pm_list) from `PrimeMovers.PVe` to
`PrimeMovers.WT`.

We assume the data needed to build each solar powered
[`RenewableDispatch`](@ref) unit is found in the CSV file `Solar_Gens.csv`,
snapshotted below.  The convention used for the contents of the `Bus` column
must be consistent with the convention used in the `Bus Number` column of
`Buses.csv`:

| Gen Name | Number | Bus | Rating (MVA) |
|:-------- |:------ |:--- |:------------ |
| Solar 01 | 1      | 32  | 746.76       |
| Solar 02 | 2      | 92  | 369.26       |
| ...      | ...    | ... | ...          |

Read in the contents of the CSV file `Solar_Gens.csv` to a data frame, and
customize the parameter names based on the column names in your CSV file and
the desired prime mover type.

```julia
solar_gens = CSV.read("MyData/Solar_Gens.csv", DataFrame)

name = "Gen Name"
num = "Number"
bus_connection = "Bus"
rate = "Rating (MVA)"
prime_mover = PrimeMovers.PVe
```

Before building the solar generators, we must also set up the solar generators'
time series. In this example, we assume that each solar generator has a unique
time series, and all of these time series are contained in one file:
`MyData/Solar_Time_Series.csv`. Here is a snapshot of this time series CSV
file, where the first column contains time stamps, and the remaining columns
are titled with its respective generator's name, and contain the time series
values in MW for each solar generator:

| Time Stamp   | Solar 01 | Solar 02 | Solar 03 | ... |
|:------------ |:-------- |:-------- |:-------- |:--- |
| ...          | ...      | ...      | ...      | ... |
| 1/1/23 09:00 | 51.36    | 118.11   | 54.92    | ... |
| 1/1/23 10:00 | 138.61   | 200.32   | 6.85     | ... |
| ...          | ...      | ...      | ...      | ... |

Each time series for its respective solar generator has an hourly resolution,
and is for the year 2023, plus one full day into 2024, for a total of 366 days,
and 8784 values per column.

Create a data frame from `Solar_Time_Series.csv` and define variables for the
aforementioned resolution and time stamps:

```julia
solar_time_series = CSV.read("MyData/Solar_Time_Series.csv", DataFrame)

resolution = Dates.Hour(1);
timestamps = range(DateTime("2023-01-01T00:00:00"); step = resolution, length = 8784);
```

In this example, we assume that the [`RenewableGenerationCost`](@ref) is at
zero marginal cost. If the marginal cost is not zero, follow similar steps to
building the [`ThermalGenerationCost`](@ref) constructor from above, but for
the [`RenewableGenerationCost`](@ref) constructor instead.

Moreover, since the example data is missing base power, we use the range of
values in the time series data to determine the value of the base power which
will be used to normalize the time series, and set the generator's rating
parameter to 1.0. (If your data reports a base power, use that for the
generator's base power, and rating data for the generator's rating).

In the same `for` loop, we will build the solar generator components using the
[`RenewableDispatch`](@ref) constructor and data stored in the `solar_gens`
data frame, and build and attach each solar generator's time series:

```julia
for row in eachrow(solar_gens)
    norm = maximum(solar_time_series[:, row[name]])
    solar_data_MW = solar_time_series[:, row[name]]
    base = row[rate]
    if any((solar_data_MW ./ base) .> 1.0)
        @warn "Generator $(row[name]) has a production larger than its base power. Normalizing by its maximum"
        base = norm
    end
    solar_array = TimeArray(timestamps, (solar_data_MW ./ base)) # normalize data
    solar_TS = SingleTimeSeries(;
        name = "max_active_power",
        data = solar_array,
        scaling_factor_multiplier = get_max_active_power,
    )
    solar = RenewableDispatch(;
        name = row[name],
        available = true,
        bus = get_bus(sys, row[bus_connection]),
        active_power = 0.0,
        reactive_power = 0.0,
        rating = 1.0,
        prime_mover_type = prime_mover,
        reactive_power_limits = (min = 0.0, max = 0.0),
        power_factor = 1.0,
        operation_cost = RenewableGenerationCost(zero(CostCurve)),
        base_power = base,
    )
    add_component!(sys, solar)
    add_time_series!(sys, solar, solar_TS)
end
```

## Adding Hydro Generators and Their Time Series

We assume the data needed to build each [`HydroDispatch`](@ref) unit is found
in a CSV file `Hydro_Gens.csv`, snapshotted below. The convention used for the
contents of the `Bus` column must be consistent with the convention used in the
`Bus Number` column of `Buses.csv`.

| Gen Name | Number | Bus | Min Stable Level (MW) | Max Capacity (MW) | Max Ramp Up (MW/min) | ... |
|:-------- |:------ |:--- |:--------------------- |:----------------- |:-------------------- |:--- |
| Hydro 01 | 1      | 56  | 0.0                   | 75.0              | 0.83                 | ... |
| Hydro 02 | 2      | 66  | 0.0                   | 77.0              | 0.86                 | ... |
| ...      | ...    | ... | ...                   | ...               | ...                  | ... |

Read in the contents of the CSV file `Hydro_Gens.csv` to a data frame and
customize the parameter names based on the column names in your CSV file.

```julia
hydro_gens = CSV.read("MyData/Hydro_Gens.csv", DataFrame)

name = "Gen Name"
bus_connection = "Bus"
num = "Number"
rate = "Rating (MVA)"
min_active_power = "Min Stable Level (MW)"
max_active_power = "Max Capacity (MW)"
ramp_up = "Max Ramp Up (MW/min)"
ramp_down = "Max Ramp Down (MW/min)"
min_up = "Min Up Time (h)"
min_down = "Min Down Time (h)"
```

Before building the hydro generators, we must also set up the hydro generators'
time series. In this example, we assume that each hydro generator has a unique
time series, and all of these time series are contained in one file:
`MyData/Hydro_Time_Series.csv`. Here is a snapshot of this time series CSV
file, where the first column contains time stamps, and the remaining columns
are titled with its respective generator's name, and contain the time series
values in MW for each hydro generator:

| Time Stamp  | Hydro 01 | Hydro 02 | Hydro 03 | ... |
|:----------- |:-------- |:-------- |:-------- |:--- |
| 1/1/23 0:00 | 0.325386 | 0.325409 | 0.314454 | ... |
| 1/1/23 1:00 | 0.325386 | 0.325409 | 0.314454 | ... |
| ...         | ...      | ...      | ...      | ... |

Each time series for its respective hydro generator has an hourly resolution,
and is for the year 2023, plus one full day into 2024, for a total of 366 days,
and 8784 values per column.

Create a data frame from `Hydro_Time_Series.csv` and define variables for the
aforementioned resolution and time stamps:

```julia
hydro_time_series = CSV.read("MyData/Hydro_Time_Series.csv", DataFrame)

resolution = Dates.Hour(1);
timestamps = range(DateTime("2023-01-01T00:00:00"); step = resolution, length = 8784);
```

In this example, we assume that the [`HydroGenerationCost`](@ref) has both zero
fixed and variable costs. Moreover, since the example data is missing base
power, we use the range of values in the time series data to determine the
value of the base power which will be used to normalize the time series and
other parameters, and set the generator's rating parameter to 1.0. (If your
data reports a base power, use that for the generator's base power, and rating
data for the generator's rating).

In the same `for` loop, we will build the hydro generator components using the
[`HydroDispatch`](@ref) constructor and data stored in the `hydro_gens`
data frame, and build and attach each hydro generator's time series:

```julia
for row in eachrow(hydro_gens)
    norm = maximum(hydro_time_series[:, row[name]])
    hydro_data_MW = hydro_time_series[:, row[name]]
    base = row[rate]
    if any((hydro_data_MW ./ base) .> 1.0)
        @warn "Generator $(row[name]) has a production larger than its base power. Normalizing by its maximum"
        base = norm
    end
    hydro_array = TimeArray(timestamps, (hydro_data_MW ./ base)) # normalize data
    hydro_TS = SingleTimeSeries(;
        name = "max_active_power",
        data = hydro_array,
        scaling_factor_multiplier = get_max_active_power,
    )
    hydro = HydroDispatch(;
        name = row[name],
        available = true,
        bus = get_bus(sys, row[bus_connection]),
        active_power = 0.0,
        reactive_power = 0.0,
        rating = 1.0,
        prime_mover_type = PrimeMovers.HA,
        active_power_limits = (
            min = row[min_active_power] / base,
            max = row[max_active_power] / base,
        ),
        reactive_power_limits = (min = 0.0, max = 0.0),
        ramp_limits = (up = row[ramp_up] / base, down = row[ramp_down] / base),
        time_limits = (up = row[min_up], down = row[min_down]),
        base_power = base,
        operation_cost = HydroGenerationCost(zero(LinearCurve), 0.0),
    )
    add_component!(sys, hydro)
    add_time_series!(sys, hydro, hydro_TS)
end
```

## Adding Loads and Their Time Series

In this example, we assume that all loads will be represented as
[`PowerLoad`](@ref) components, and that the loads are located in three
regions. Each region has one unique time series, and every load in each region
is assigned its region's normalized time series profile.

The data needed to build each [`PowerLoad`](@ref) unit is found in the CSV file
`Loads.csv`, snapshotted below. The convention used for the contents of the
`Bus` column must be consistent with the convention used in the `Bus Number`
column of `Buses.csv`, and similarly for the `Region` column.

| Load Number | Bus | Region | Participation Factor |
|:----------- |:--- |:------ |:-------------------- |
| 1           | 1   | R1     | 0.047168669          |
| 2           | 2   | R2     | 0.0184963            |
| ...         | ... | ...    | ...                  |

Read in the contents of the CSV file `Loads.csv` to a data frame and customize
the parameter names based on the column names in your CSV file.

```julia
load_params = CSV.read("MyData/Loads.csv", DataFrame)

region = "Region"
bus_connection = "Bus"
factor = "Load Participation Factor"
number = "Load Number"
```

Before building the loads, we must also set up the loads' time series. In this
example, we assume that each load region has a unique time series, and all of
these time series are contained in one file: `MyData/Load_Time_Series.csv`.
Here is a snapshot of this time series CSV file, where the first column
contains time stamps, and the remaining columns are titled with its respective
region's name, and contain the time series values in MW for each region:

| Time Stamp  | R1         | R2         | R3         |
|:----------- |:---------- |:---------- |:---------- |
| 1/1/23 0:00 | 5465.7296  | 1904.4448  | 2486.38409 |
| 1/1/23 1:00 | 4994.53821 | 1726.22134 | 2273.63274 |
| ...         | ...        | ...        | ...        |

Each time series for its respective load region has an hourly resolution, and
is for the year 2023, plus one full day into 2024, for a total of 366 days, and
8784 values per column. Ensure that your time series file is similarly
formatted.

Create a data frame from `Load_Time_Series.csv` and define variables for the
aforementioned resolution and time stamps:

```julia
load_time_series = CSV.read("MyData/Load_Time_Series.csv", DataFrame)

resolution = Dates.Hour(1);
timestamps = range(DateTime("2023-01-01T00:00:00"); step = resolution, length = 8784);
```

Construct and attach the loads to the system using the [`PowerLoad`](@ref)
constructor according to their regions. Because all loads in each region share
a time series profile, the `max_active_power` of each load will depend on the
maximum time series value of its region and its load participation factor.

```julia
for row in eachrow(load_params)
    num = row[number]
    max = maximum(load_time_series[:, row[region]])
    load = PowerLoad(;
        name = "load$num",
        available = true,
        bus = get_bus(sys, row[bus_connection]),
        active_power = 0.0,
        reactive_power = 0.0,
        base_power = system_base_power,
        max_active_power = (max) * (row[factor]) / system_base_power,
        max_reactive_power = 0.0,
    )
    add_component!(sys, load)
end
```

In a `for` loop, iterate over the regions in your [`System`](@ref), and use the
[`begin_time_series_update`](@ref) function to create and attach the respective
loads' time series to every load in a region at once. Note: due to how
`max_active_power` is defined, the time series values are normalized to its
maximum.

```julia
regions = unique(load_params[:, region])

for reg in regions
    norm = maximum(load_time_series[:, reg])
    load_array = TimeArray(
        timestamps,
        (load_time_series[:, reg] ./ norm),
    )
    load_TS = SingleTimeSeries(;
        name = "max_active_power",
        data = load_array,
        scaling_factor_multiplier = get_max_active_power,
    )
    region = get_component(Area, sys, reg)
    begin_time_series_update(sys) do
        for component in get_components_in_aggregation_topology(PowerLoad, sys, region)
            add_time_series!(sys, component, load_TS)
        end
    end
end
```
