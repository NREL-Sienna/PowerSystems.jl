# [Migrating from version 4.0 to 5.0](@id psy5_migration)

This guide outlines the code updates required to upgrade from PowerSystems.jl version 4.0
to 5.0, which was released in May 2025 and includes breaking changes. These are:

  - [AC Branches Type Hierarchy Change](@ref)
  - [New and Eliminated Types](@ref)
  - [Updates to Energy Storage Parameters](@ref esr_migration)
  - [Hydropower `status` added](@ref)
  - [New Cost Functions](@ref)
  - [New Time Series Horizon Format](@ref)
  - [Minor Type Hierarchy Change](@ref)
  - [(Temporary) Use Version 3.0 for `HybridSystem` (+ new parameter)](@ref)

## AC Branches Type Hierarchy Change

New abstract type [`ACTransmission`](@ref) and was created to better distinguish between AC transmission objects connected between [`ACBus`](@ref) the new added [`TwoTerminalHVDC`](@ref) abstract type to caputre HVDC links connected between [`ACBus`](@ref).

## Renamed Types and Parameters

Some `Types` and fields were renamed, which should require a trivial search and replace:

Renamed `Types`:

  - `TwoTerminalHVDC` is now named [`TwoTerminalGenericHVDC`](@ref)
  - `TimeSeriesForcedOutage` is now named [`FixedOutage`](@ref)

New parameters:

  - The [`ACTransmission`](@ref) objects now have rating fields for `b` and `c` ratings to enable modeling security constrained problems. Affected Types are:

      + [`Line`](@ref)
      + [`MonitoredLine`](@ref)
      + [`PhaseShiftingTransformer`](@ref)
      + [`TapTransformer`](@ref)
      + [`Transformer2W`](@ref)

## New and Eliminated Types

  - [`Transformer3W`](@ref)
  - [`TwoTerminalLCCLine`](@ref)
  - [`TwoTerminalVSCLine`](@ref)
  - [`HydroReservoir`](@ref)
  - [`HydroTurbine`](@ref)
  - [`HydroPumpTurbine`](@ref)
  - [`ShiftablePowerLoad](@ref)
  - [`DiscreteControlledACBranch`](@ref)
  - [`FACTSControlDevice`](@ref)
  - [`ImpedanceCorrectionData`](@ref)

These types are no longer part of PowerSystems.jl:

  - `TwoTerminalVSDCLine`
  - `HydroPumpedStorage` (see [Updates to Hydro Storage related devices](@ref hyd_migration))
  - `HydroEnergyReservoir` (see [Updates to Hydro Storage related devices](@ref hyd_migration))
