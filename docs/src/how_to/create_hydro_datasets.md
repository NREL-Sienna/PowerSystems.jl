# [Define Hydro Generators with Reservoirs](@id hydro_resv)

In the current version of `PowerSystems.jl` there is support and testing for hydropower generation plants with the following structures:

## Shared Upstream Reservoir

  end
 subgraph s2["HydroPlant 1"]
        D["Turbine C"]
  end

```

For this model, attach an upstream [`HydroReservoir`](@ref) to any number of [`HydroTurbine`](@ref)s. This can model different power house elevations to consider the effect of the elevation and pressure heads on the specific turbines inside of a power plant.

### Example: Single Turbine with Single Reservoir

```julia
using PowerSystems
const PSY = PowerSystems

# Create a system
sys = System(100.0)
set_units_base_system!(sys, "NATURAL_UNITS")

# Create and add a bus
bus = ACBus(;
    number = 1,
    name = "bus1",
    available = true, 
    bustype = ACBusTypes.PV,
    angle = 0.0,
    magnitude = 1.0,
    voltage_limits = (min = 0.9, max = 1.1),
    base_voltage = 230.0,
    area = nothing,
    load_zone = nothing,
)
add_component!(sys, bus)

# Create a HydroTurbine
turbine = HydroTurbine(;
    name = "Turbine1",
    available = true,
    bus = bus,
    active_power = 50.0,
    reactive_power = 10.0,
    rating = 100.0,
    base_power = 100.0,
    active_power_limits = (min = 10.0, max = 100.0),
    reactive_power_limits = (min = -50.0, max = 50.0),
    powerhouse_elevation = 500.0,  # meters above sea level
    efficiency = 0.9,
    conversion_factor = 1.0,
    outflow_limits = (min = 0.0, max = 1000.0),  # m³/s
    travel_time = 0.5,  # hours
)
add_component!(sys, turbine)

# Create a HydroReservoir
reservoir = HydroReservoir(;
    name = "Reservoir1",
    available = true,
    storage_level_limits = (min = 1000.0, max = 10000.0),  # m³
    initial_level = 0.8,  # 80% of max
    spillage_limits = (min = 0.0, max = 500.0),
    inflow = 100.0,  # m³/h
    outflow = 50.0,  # m³/h
    level_targets = 0.7,
    intake_elevation = 600.0,  # meters above sea level
    head_to_volume_factor = LinearCurve(1.0),
)
add_component!(sys, reservoir)

# Link the turbine to the reservoir as a downstream turbine
set_downstream_turbine!(reservoir, turbine)

# Verify the connection
@assert has_downstream_turbine(reservoir, turbine)
@assert length(get_connected_head_reservoirs(sys, turbine)) == 1
```

### Example: Multiple Turbines with Single Reservoir

```julia

sys = System(100.0)
set_units_base_system!(sys, "NATURAL_UNITS")

# Create and add a bus
bus = ACBus(;
    number = 1,
    name = "bus1",

    magnitude = 1.0,
    voltage_limits = (min = 0.9, max = 1.1),
    base_voltage = 230.0,
    area = nothing,
    load_zone = nothing,
)
add_component!(sys, bus)
# Create multiple turbines and connect them to a single reservoir
turbines = []
for i in 1:5
    turbine = HydroTurbine(;
        name = "Turbine$i",
        available = true,
        bus = bus,
        active_power = 20.0,
        reactive_power = 5.0,
        rating = 50.0,
        base_power = 100.0,
        active_power_limits = (min = 5.0, max = 50.0),
        reactive_power_limits = nothing,
        powerhouse_elevation = 500.0 + i * 10.0,  # Different elevations
        efficiency = 0.85 + i * 0.02,
    )
    add_component!(sys, turbine)
    push!(turbines, turbine)
end

# Link all turbines at once
set_downstream_turbines!(reservoir, turbines)

# Verify connections
@assert has_downstream_turbine(reservoir)
@assert length(get_downstream_turbines(reservoir)) == 5
```

## Head and Tail Reservoirs for Pumped Hydropower Plants

For this model, attach two [`HydroReservoir`](@ref)s to any number of [`HydroPumpTurbine`](@ref)s. The turbine and reservoir structs store the elevations to calculate the elevation and pressure heads for the facility.

        C["Turbine B"]
  end
