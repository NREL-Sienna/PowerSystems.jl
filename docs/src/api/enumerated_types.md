# Specifying the type of...

Some fields in PowerSystems.jl are specified with an option from a pre-defined list
(Specified with [`IS.scoped_enums`](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/InfrastructureSystems.jl/stable/InfrastructureSystems/#InfrastructureSystems.@scoped_enum-Tuple%7BAny,%20Vararg%7BAny,%20N%7D%20where%20N%7D)).

Example syntax:

```
set_fuel!(gen, ThermalFuels.COAL)
```

These predefined lists are below:
