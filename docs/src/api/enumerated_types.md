# Specifying the type of...

Some fields in PowerSystems.jl are specified with an option from a pre-defined list
(Specified with [`IS.scoped_enums`](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/InfrastructureSystems.jl/stable/InfrastructureSystems/#InfrastructureSystems.@scoped_enum-Tuple{Any,%20Vararg{Any,%20N}%20where%20N})).
