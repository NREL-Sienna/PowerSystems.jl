# Adding additional fields

All components currently implemented in `PowerSystems.jl` have an `ext` field that contains
an empty `Dictionary`. This empty dictionary can be accessed with the method `get_ext`.
shows an example of adding additional data to the [`ThermalStandard`](@ref) structs for other
modeling requirements.

This method is useful if there is no requirement to create new behaviours for components of
a particular type but additional fields are required. A simple example is the addition of geographic information if needed.
