## Overview

`PowerSystems.jl` is a [`Julia`](http://www.julialang.org) package that provides a rigorous
data model using Julia structures to enable power systems modeling. `PowerSystems.jl` is
agnostic to a specific mathematical model and can be used for many model categories.

`PowerSystems.jl` provides tools to prepare and process data useful
for electric energy systems modeling. This package serves two purposes:

1. It facilitates the development and open sharing of large data sets for Power Systems modeling
2. It provides a data model that imposes discipline on model specification, addressing the challenge of design and terminology choices when sharing code and data.

The main features include:

- Comprehensive and extensible library of data structures for electric systems modeling.
- Large scale data set development tools based on common text based data formats
  (PSS/e `.raw` and `.dyr`, and `MATPOWER`) and configurable tabular data (e.g. CSV)
  parsing capabilities.
- Optimized container for component data and time series supporting serialization to
  portable file formats and configurable validation routines.

`PowerSystems.jl` documentation and code are organized according to the needs of different
users depending on their skillset and requirements. In broad terms there are three categories:

- **Modeler**: Users that want to run a particular analysis or experiment and use `PowerSystems.jl` to develop data sets.

- **Model Developer**: Users that want to develop custom components and structs in order to exploit `PowerSystems.jl` features to produce custom data sets.

- **Code Base Developers**: Users that want to add new core functionalities or fix bugs in the core capabilities of `PowerSystems.jl`.

`PowerSystems.jl` is an active project under development, and we welcome your feedback,
suggestions, and bug reports.

**Note**: `PowerSystems.jl` uses [`InfrastructureSystems.jl`](https://github.com/NREL-Sienna/InfrastructureSystems.jl)
as a utility library. Several methods are re-exported from `InfrastructureSystems.jl`.
For most users there is no need to import `InfrastructureSystems.jl`.

## Installation

The latest stable release of PowerSystems can be installed using the Julia package manager with

```julia
] add PowerSystems
```

For the current development version, "checkout" this package with

```julia
] add PowerSystems#main
```
