# [Type Structure](@id type_structure)

PowerSystems.jl provides a type hierarchy to contain power system data.

### Types in PowerSystems

In PowerSystems.jl, data that describes infrastructure components is held in `struct`s.
For example, an `ACBus` is a `struct` with the following parameters to describe a bus
on an AC network:

```@repl types
using PowerSystems #hide
import TypeTree: tt #hide
docs_dir = joinpath(pkgdir(PowerSystems), "docs", "src", "tutorials", "utils"); #hide
include(joinpath(docs_dir, "docs_utils.jl")); #hide
print_struct(ACBus) #hide
```

### Type Hierarchy

PowerSystems is intended to organize data by the behavior of the devices that
the data represents. A type hierarchy has been defined with several levels of
abstract types starting with `InfrastructureSystemsType`. There are a bunch of subtypes of
`InfrastructureSystemsType`, but the important ones to know about are:

- `System`: overarching `struct` that collects all of the `Component`s
- `Component`: includes all elements of power system data
  - `Topology`: includes non physical elements describing network connectivity
  - `Service`: includes descriptions of system requirements (other than energy balance)
  - `Device`: includes descriptions of all the physical devices in a power system
- `InfrastructureSystems.DeviceParameter`: includes structs that hold data describing the
 dynamic, or economic capabilities of `Device`.
- `TimeSeriesData`: Includes all time series types
  - `Forecast`: includes structs to define time series of forecasted data where multiple
values can represent each time stamp
  - `StaticTimeSeries`: includes structs to define time series with a single value for each
time stamp

The abstract hierarchy enables categorization of the devices by their operational
characteristics and modeling requirements.

For instance, generation is classified by the distinctive
data requirements for modeling in three categories: [`ThermalGen`](@ref), [`RenewableGen`](@ref),
and [`HydroGen`](@ref).

`PowerSystems.jl` has a category [`Topology`](@ref) of topological components
(e.g., [`ACBus`](@ref), [`Arc`](@ref)), separate from the physical components.

The hierarchy also includes components absent in standard data models, such as services.
The services category includes reserves, transfers and [`AGC`](@ref). The power of `PowerSystems.jl`
lies in providing the abstraction without an implicit mathematical representation of the component.

As a result of this design, developers can define model logic entirely based on abstract
types and create generic code to support modeling technologies that are not yet
implemented in the package.
