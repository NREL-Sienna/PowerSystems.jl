# Dynamic Devices

Each sub-type is composed of the corresponding dynamic components that define the model. As
a result, it is possible to flexibly define dynamic data models and methods according to
the analysis requirements. [`DynamicInjection`](@ref) components use parametric a parametric
type pattern to materialize the full specification of the dynamic injection model with
parameters. This design enable the use of parametric methods to specify the mathematical
model of the dynamic components separately.

[`DynamicInjection`](@ref) components also implement some additional information useful for
the modeling like the usual states assumed by the model and the number. These values are
derived from the documentation associated with the model, for instance PSS/e models provide
parameters, states and variables. Although `PowerSystems.jl` doesn't assume a specific
mathematical model for the components, the default values for these parameters are derived
directly from the data model source.

## Dynamic Generator

Each generator is a data structure that is defined by the following components:

- [Machine](@ref Machine): That defines the stator electro-magnetic dynamics.
- [Shaft](@ref Shaft): That describes the rotor electro-mechanical dynamics.
- [Automatic Voltage Regulator](@ref AVR): Electromotive dynamics to model an AVR controller.
- [Power System Stabilizer](@ref PSS): Control dynamics to define an stabilization signal for the AVR.
- [Prime Mover and Turbine Governor](@ref TurbineGov): Thermo-mechanical dynamics and associated controllers.

Each inverter is a data structure that is defined by the following components:

- [DC Source](@ref DCSource): Defines the dynamics of the DC side of the converter.
- [Frequency Estimator](@ref FrequencyEstimator): That describes how the frequency of the grid
  can be estimated using the grid voltages. Typically a phase-locked loop (PLL).
- [Outer Loop Control](@ref OuterControl): That describes the active and reactive power
  control dynamics.
- [Inner Loop Control](@ref InnerControl): That can describe virtual impedance,
  voltage control and current control dynamics.
- [Converter](@ref Converter): That describes the dynamics of the pulse width modulation (PWM)
  or space vector modulation (SVM).
- [Filter](@ref Filter): Used to connect the converter output to the grid.
