Defer a component→component reference a `from_openapi` converter cannot resolve on its own
first pass: either a genuine forward reference (the referenced type converts later in
`DOCUMENT_PLAN`) or a same-type reference (the referenced component is of the SAME type,
converted earlier or later within that type's own document-key pass, so no `DOCUMENT_PLAN`
reordering could express it — a cascading `HydroReservoir` chain is the motivating case).

A converter facing either one constructs its component with that field left at its own
empty/`nothing` default, then calls `defer_ref!(refs, f)` with a zero-argument `f` that
performs the resolution (typically closing over the constructed component, `refs`, and the
raw ids still to resolve) via a mutating setter. `f` runs later, from
[`resolve_deferred_refs!`](@ref), once every component in the document is registered — a raw
id still unresolvable then is genuinely absent from the document and errors from `refs`'s own
`getindex`, not from here.
