# Typed extraction at the PO boundary, for the generated `from_openapi` methods.
#
# `PowerOperationsOpenAPIModels`' generated structs declare every `$ref`ed field as bare
# `Any` — 7 of the 22 fields on `PO.ThermalMultiStart` — so `po.active_power_limits.min`
# is a dynamic `getproperty` chain that annotating `po` cannot recover: the type is
# genuinely absent from the struct definition, not merely unstated at the call. These
# helpers restore it by dispatching on the `PC` compound struct once, at the boundary,
# after which every member access is a concrete field load.
#
# One name per alias, not the four the export side needs
# (`OPENAPI_EXPORT_COMPOUND_CTORS`): the required/optional split is dispatch on
# `::Nothing`, and the natural-units split is the `op`/`base` arity. That also lets the
# generator drop the `if isnothing(po.x)` wrapper it used to emit around every nullable
# compound.
#
# `op` is passed as a function rather than baked into separate `_scaled`/`_unscaled`
# helpers so the emitted arithmetic stays exactly what it was — `/` for power and
# impedance, `*` for admittance. Rewriting `x / base` as `x * inv(base)` would change the
# last bits of every converted value.
