AngleUnits

An enumeration of angular measurement units used throughout the PowerSystems package.

Values
- `DEGREES`: Angles expressed in degrees.
- `RADIANS`: Angles expressed in radians.

Usage
Use `AngleUnits` to make unit semantics explicit for functions, fields, and APIs that accept or return angular values. When performing trigonometric calculations with Base functions (`sin`, `cos`, etc.), convert degrees to radians (e.g., `θ * π/180`) if the unit is `DEGREES`.

Examples
julia> unit = AngleUnits.DEGREES
AngleUnits.DEGREES

julia> θ = 30.0
julia> θ_rad = unit == AngleUnits.DEGREES ? θ * (π/180) : θ

@doc"
ACBusTypes

Enumeration of AC power system bus types (MATPOWER Table B‑1).
Each variant corresponds to a standard bus classification used in power flow
and steady‑state network models:

- PQ (1): Load bus — active (P) and reactive (Q) power injections are specified;
    the bus voltage magnitude and angle are solved by the power‑flow algorithm.
- PV (2): Generator (PV) bus — active power (P) and voltage magnitude (V) are
    specified; reactive power (Q) and voltage angle are solved.
- REF (3): Reference bus — a named reference for the system voltage angle; often
    equivalent to a slack bus in semantics but provided separately for clarity.
- ISOLATED (4): Isolated bus — not connected to the main network (islanded or
    disconnected); typically excluded from the global power‑flow solution.
- SLACK (5): Slack bus — balances the system active and reactive power mismatch
    and sets the reference voltage angle (commonly one per connected network).

Notes
- Numeric values follow the MATPOWER convention for bus type codes.
- Use the enum members (e.g., `ACBusTypes.PQ`, `ACBusTypes.SLACK`) when
    constructing or interpreting network data structures to ensure clarity and
    compatibility with MATPOWER-based data conventions.

    LoadConformity

WECC-defined enumeration for load conformity classification used in dynamic modeling.

Load conformity indicates whether a load follows system voltage and frequency variations
according to WECC modeling standards:

- `NON_CONFORMING = 0`: Load that does not respond predictably to voltage and frequency changes,
  typically representing constant power loads or loads with complex control systems
- `CONFORMING = 1`: Load that responds predictably to voltage and frequency variations,
  following standard load modeling practices for dynamic studies
- `UNDEFINED = 2`: Load conformity status is not specified or unknown

This classification is essential for WECC dynamic studies as it determines how loads are
modeled during system disturbances and stability analysis.
