ACBusTypes

Enumeration of AC power system bus types (MATPOWER Table B-1).
Each variant corresponds to a standard bus classification used in power flow
and steady-state network models. Set on an [`ACBus`](@ref) via the `bustype` field.

- `PQ` (1): Load bus — active (P) and reactive (Q) power injections are specified;
    the bus voltage magnitude and angle are solved by the power-flow algorithm.
- `PV` (2): Generator bus — active power (P) and voltage magnitude (V) are
    specified; reactive power (Q) and voltage angle are solved.
- `REF` (3): Reference bus — provides a named reference for the system voltage
    angle; often used interchangeably with `SLACK` but kept separate for clarity.
- `ISOLATED` (4): Isolated bus — not connected to the main network; typically
    excluded from the global power-flow solution.
- `SLACK` (5): Slack bus — balances system active and reactive power mismatch and
    sets the reference voltage angle (typically one per connected network).

# Notes
- Numeric values follow the MATPOWER convention for bus type codes.
- Use the enum members (e.g., `ACBusTypes.PQ`, `ACBusTypes.SLACK`) when
    constructing or interpreting network data to ensure compatibility with
    MATPOWER-based data conventions.
