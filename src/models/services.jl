"""
All subtypes of Service define contributingdevices::Vector{Device}. The values get populated
with references to existing devices. The following functions override JSON encoding to
replace the devices with their UUIDs. This solves two problems:

1. The information is redundant, consuming unnecessary space. Also, a user could modify
   information in the JSON file in one place but not the other, which would be very
   problematic.
2. The contributingdevices are stored in an vector of abstract types. JSON doesn't provide a
   way to encode the actual concrete type, so deserialization would have to infer the type.
   There is no guessing if the UUIDs are stored instead. The deserialization process can
   replace the references with actual devices.

These functions could be re-defined to accept subtypes of Component or PowerSystemType.
This is the minimum amount needed for now.
