"""
Abstract type for devices that [inject](@ref I) power or current.

A [static](@ref S) injection is a steady state injection, such as modeling
the output power of a generator held constant over a five-minute period.

Many `StaticInjection` models can accept a [`DynamicInjection`](@ref) model
as an optional add-on for conducting [dynamic](@ref D) simulations.

Subtypes: [`Generator`](@ref), [`ElectricLoad`](@ref), [`Storage`](@ref),
[`StaticInjectionSubsystem`](@ref)
