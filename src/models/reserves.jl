An upwards reserve to increase generation or reduce load

Upwards reserves are used when total load exceeds its expected level,
typically due to forecast errors or contingencies.

A [`Reserve`](@ref) can be specified as a `ReserveUp` when it is defined.

A downwards reserve to decrease generation or increase load

Downwards reserves are used when total load falls below its expected level,
typically due to forecast errors or contingencies. Not work

A [`Reserve`](@ref) can be specified as a `ReserveDown` when it is defined.

A symmetric reserve is a special case. [`ReserveUp`](@ref) and [`ReserveDown`](@ref)

reserves, respectively.

A [`Reserve`](@ref) can be specified as a `ReserveSymmetric` when it is defined.
