The `PowerSystems.jl` package provides a rigorous data model using Julia structures to enable power systems analysis. In addition to stand-alone system analysis tools and model building, the `PowerSystems.jl` package is used as the foundational data container for the [PowerSimulations.jl](https://github.com/NREL/PowerSimulations.jl) package. `PowerSystems.jl` enables data structures for different devices and relies on a limited number of data file formats for parsing.

## Version Advisory 

- The latest tagged version in PowerSystems (v0.1.0) will work with Julia v0.6 only. 
- The master branch in PowerSystems is designed to work in Julia v0.7 or newer only.  

### Device data enabled in PowerSystems:
 - Generators (Thermal, Renewable, Synchronous Condensers, and Hydro)
 - Transmission (Lines, and Transformers)
 - Active Flow control devices (DC Lines and phase-shifters)
 - Topological elements (Buses, Areas)
 - Storage (Batteries)
 - Load (Static, and curtailable)
 - Services (Reserves, inter-regional transfers)
 - Forecasts (Deterministic, scenario, stochastic)

### Parsing capabilities in PowerSystems:
 - MATPOWER CaseFormat
 - PSS/E - PTI Format
 - [RTS-GMLC](https://github.com/GridMod/RTS-GMLC/tree/master/RTS_Data/SourceData) data format

## Installation
